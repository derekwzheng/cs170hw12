(a) k  | Error Rate
  ----------------------------
  | 1  | 8.899999999999997%  |
  | 2  | 13.100000000000001% |
  | 5  | 9.599999999999998%  |
  | 10 | 11.6%               |
  | 25 | 13.100000000000001% |

  The value k = 1 is the best.

(b) When there is a tie, we choose the closest neighbor to classify an image.

(c) No. The algorithm does not perform significantly differently for k = 1 and k = 2. Because the way we break tie
    is to choose the closest neighbor. Then if there is a tie, then we classify the image to be the same class as
    the closest neighbor. So, the second closest neighbor does not really affect the result.

(d) I look at the misclassified examples and realize the classifier always confuse about the following pairs:
    (1, 7)
    (3, 8)
    (1, 4)
    (6, 8)
    ...
    The reason why the classifier makes mistakes is because some numbers are very similar. For example, both the
    number 6 and the number 8 contain a "cycle". Both the number 1 and the number 7 contain a vertical
    bar.
    So, I think we can add more features to increase the accuracy.
    i) We can add a cycle detection to detect whether a handwritten digit has a cycle. If it does, then it is
        probably one of '2', '3', '6', '8', '9', or '0'.
    ii) We can add a vertical bar detection to detect whether a handwritten digit has a vertical bar. It it does,
        it probably is one of '1', '4', or '7'.
